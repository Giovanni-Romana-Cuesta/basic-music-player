# basic-music-player

This is a music player that has the basic functions: 
- Play and pause a song. 
- Play a song randomly 
- Repeat a song. 
- Advance a song using a slider 
- Control the volume

This mini project is made using HTML, CSS and Javascript without any framework.

For now the songs are stored locally but I plan to add the possibility to load the songs from a database and also to add more songs from the computer.
